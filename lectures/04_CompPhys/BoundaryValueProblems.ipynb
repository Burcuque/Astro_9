    "In our study of second-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), we have limited ourselves to solving **initial value** problems. In other words, we looked at problems where we were given an initial condition for all dependent variables of our system. Take, for example, our nonlinear pendulum, where we fed both a starting angle $\\theta_0$ and an initial angular velocity $\\omega_0$. This is also the case for our projectile example, where we fed initial positions $x_0,\\ y_0$ and initial velocities, $v_{x,0},\\ v_{y,0}$. We then used the techniques for solving ODEs for integrating the solution out to some ending time $t_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another form of problem called **boundary value problems**, where we are given both an initial and final condition. In other words, the conditions straddle the boundary of the solution. Our task is to find the solution that passes through both the initial and final condition. One example of this can be seen going back to our projectile ODE: instead of feeding initial positions and initial velocities, we can feed an initial position and a final position, and solve for what initial velocity gives us a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this through trial and error, until we converge upon initial conditions that, when combined with our ODE, result in the desired final conditions. This is called, the **shooting method**.\n",

    "We could search for the right initial conditions by hand, but rarely in computational physics do we want to do anything by hand (the motto for this course), so we should come-up with algorithm that will do this for us. Let's start by re-formulating the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we are given one initial condition, $x_i$ and one final condition, $x_f$. Our task is to search for another initial condition, $\\theta_i$, that when combined with our differential equations, satisfies our given conditions, $x_i$ and $x_f$. One way to view this is to assume there is some function that maps the unknown initial condition to the ODE solution: $f(\\theta_i) = x$. What we want is to find $\\theta_i$ that makes $f(\\theta_i) = x_f$. Another way to phrase this is that we want\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f(\\theta_i) - x_f = 0\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "which means we want to find the **root** of the expression on the left as a function of $\\theta_i$. We can do this with a root finding method, which we haven't yet discussed, so let's spend some time talking about one particular root-finding method called the **binary search** method."

    "### Binary Search Root Finding Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind a root finding algorithm is this: we have some continuous function that at some point crosses the x-axis, which is to say that it's y-value is zero. This can happen multiple times, but it needs to happen at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='imgs/binary_search.png' width=400px/>\n",
    "<center>Figure 6.3, Newman</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the binary search method is to place two starting points, $x_1$ and $x_2$, separated by a wide distance which we will call $\\ell$. We then evaluate our expression and compare the parity (positive or negative) of the expression at these two points. If they have opposite parity, then that means there is at least one root in the space between our points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we take a new point, $x^{\\prime}$, that is halfway between our two original points and evalute the parity of the expression there. If, by chance, the expression actually equals zero, then we have achieved our goal and we stop. This will almost never be the case, so typically what we do is compare its parity with our previous two points and select the one that has opposite parity. The root of the expression now must lie somewhere in between this midpoint and that original point, meaning we have narrowed down the possible locations where the root lies. In other words, $\\ell$ is now equal to $\\ell/2$. We repeat this until we have an $\\ell$ that has converged to some tolerance and we stop and say the root is somewhere near the midpoint of our last iteration. "
