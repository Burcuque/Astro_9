There are times, however, when we need higher precision integration schemes. One way to do this is to change the way we approximate the slices of our integral. In the trapezoidal rule, we took the top of our slices to be lines, that is, a first order polynomial. To do better, we can model the tops of our slices as second order polynomials, also known as quadratics. As we will see, this will yield a more accurate integration scheme, and is called [Simpson's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule).\n",

    "We have acknowledged (and seen firsthand) that our numerical integration schemes are not exact; they are only approximations. It is informative to know roughly how accurate these schemes are, and how their precision compares to one another. What does the error of the numerical integral depend on? We have already seen that the fundamental parameter determining its accuracy is the width, $h$, of an individual slice: the smaller the width, the more accurate the integral. But how does the accuracy of the integration change as we change $h$?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, we need to derive the *Euler-Maclaurin* formula for the trapezoidal rule. Section 5.2 of Newman does just this. You can read it yourself if you like, but we won't cover it here. Suffice it to say, what we find is that the trapezoidal scheme has an error that, to leading order, scales as the slice width squared: $\\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$. Because of this, we call the trapezoidal rule a *first-order* scheme, meaning it is accurate to $\\mathcal{O}(h)$ and has error to $\\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$. Simpson's rule is a *third-order* scheme, meaning it is accurate to $\\mathcal{O}(h^{3})$ and has error that goes as $\\mathcal{O}(h^{4})$.\n",

To do this, let's evaluate both the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule for various specifications of $h$, calculate the integral's error with respect to the true value, and then plot that error as a function of $h$. If the error behaves as a quadratic, then we know that $\\epsilon\\propto h^{2}$.\n",
