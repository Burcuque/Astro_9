    "Let's say you made some changes and commits to your files since your first commit and you realize that these new additions were faulty: perhaps they added unwanted bugs to your code. In this case, we would like to either 1) undo some of the commits that we think introduced the bug, or 2) undo all commits all the way back to some previous commit. This is another one of the useful functionalities of Git. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have identified a single commit as the faulty commit, and would like to undo the changes introduced by that commit (not necessarily the most recent commit), but keep all other commits between that commit and your current state. We can accomplish this with\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git revert <commit-tag>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This moves the commit history forward by generating a new commit which actually undoes the commit of `<commit-tag>`, to the best of git's capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say we actually want to undo all commits all the way back to some previous commit. One way of doing this is to perform a `git revert` on every single commit all the way down the line. If you check your `git log`, you can see that while you are reverting the files to reflect the old commits, you are keeping a linear order to your commit history. This is useful in the case that you wan't to reinstate these commits at some future point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say you are really sure the edits you have made are bad, and you want to revert back to an old state and not add the revert to your commit history. To do this, you can use `git reset`, but be careful, because this is a **permanent action**. If you want to change the commit history and the files in your working directory use\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset --hard <commit-tag>\n",

This means we can easily share our files with others, and also access our files from anywhere and any machine! To use it you'll need to make an account. Once you have an account, press the \"+\" buttom near the top-right to start a new repository. Name the repo the same name as your directory, keep it a public repo, and **do not** initialize it with a README file. Copy & paste the code corresponding to pushing an already existing repository, and enter that into your command shell located in your local repository to set up the remote (aka which online repo this local repo connects to), and to make your first pull.

Another powerful feature of git is the ability to create and track multiple versions of your repositories. This is called branching.

When the edits are completed, they can **merge** their commits back onto the master branch.\n",
