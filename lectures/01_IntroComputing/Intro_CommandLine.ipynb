    "A command line interface, or a command shell, is a way to directly interact with a computer with your keyboard. You can create, edit, move, delete files, and perform for complex tasks through the shell scripting language. In contrast, with a Graphical User Interface (aka point-and-click), identifying and opening files is visually easy, but handing large numbers of files and performing complex tasks is hard.\n",

    "To keep track of where things are, all of the information stored in your computer is assigned a location in your computer's directory tree. Both a GUI and a CLI operate *within* the tree structure. All of the files on your \"Desktop\" for example, lie in the directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "/Users/username/Desktop\n",
    "```\n",

    "If you don't know your computer's username, you can use the function\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "cd Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "will move your working directory to your Desktop. When moving from directory to directory, you can use the desired path name *from your current working directory*, as we did before. Or you can feed the full pathname from the base directory, like\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /Users/nkern/Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will accomplish the same thing as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also move \"relative\" to your current directory with the \"./\" and \"../\" prefixes. \"./\" means \"my current working directory\" and \"../\" means \"one directory above my current directory\". We can therefore accomplish the same directory change as\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "cd\n",

    "ls -F\n",
    "Desktop/ Documents/ example_file.txt\n",

The last operator you may know as the modulus operator, which returns the remainder numerator after division. Because 7 / 4 = 1 + 3/4, the remainder is 3/4, and the mod operator returns its numerator which is 3. "
