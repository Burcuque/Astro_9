    "A command line interface, or a command shell, is a way to directly interact with a computer with your keyboard. You can create, edit, move, delete files, and perform for complex tasks through the shell scripting language. In contrast, with a Graphical User Interface (aka point-and-click), identifying and opening files is visually easy, but handing large numbers of files and performing complex tasks is hard.\n",

Keep in mind that for all of the commands we will look at, you can get a detailed description of the commands by looking at their \"manuals\" which can be accessed with the command\n",

    "To keep track of where things are, all of the information stored in your computer is assigned a location in your computer's directory tree. Both a GUI and a CLI operate *within* the tree structure. All of the files on your \"Desktop\" for example, lie in the directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "/Users/username/Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know your computer's username, you can use the function\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "whoami\n",
    "```\n",
    "and it will print out your username.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Print Working Directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out what directory your command shell is currently working in, you can use\n",

    "pwd\n",

    "to Print your Working Directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Change Directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "To change your working directory, you can use the \"cd\" function. The following command,\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "will move your working directory to your Desktop. When moving from directory to directory, you can use the desired path name *from your current working directory*, as we did before. Or you can feed the full pathname from the base directory, like\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /Users/nkern/Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will accomplish the same thing as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also move \"relative\" to your current directory with the \"./\" and \"../\" prefixes. \"./\" means \"my current working directory\" and \"../\" means \"one directory above my current directory\". We can therefore accomplish the same directory change as\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ./Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To move back to /Users/username, you could then use\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ../\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an inherently specified **home directory**, which is typically by default your \"Users/username\" directory. This is the directory you will land in by default when you open a fresh command shell. You can automatically move to your home directory by using the cd command with no argument:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd\n",
    "```\n",
    "Your home directory can also be accessed via the \"~\" symbol. Meaning that if you wanted to access your Desktop from anywhere within your computer, instead of typing \"Users/username/Desktop\" you can use\n",

    "cd ~/Desktop\n",
    "```\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will list everything currently in your Desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many commands also take **flags**, which are optional arguments that tell the command to do something a little more specific. The list command, for example the flag \"-F\" will distinguish sub-directories from files\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -F\n",
    "Desktop/ Documents/ example_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can see the two sub-directories are distinguished from files by an extra \"/\" at the end of their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feed the \"-a\" flag standing for \"all\" you will list all files and directories, including the \"hidden\" ones, which have a \".\" prefix\n",

    "./ ../ Desktop/ Documents/ example_file.txt .hidden_file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wild Characters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Wild characters are ```*``` and ```?```, which are place-fillers for any character. The first is a place holder for any character and any amount of them, and the second is a place holder for any one character. We can use these in unique ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate, let's first create some files\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo hello > myfile1\n",
    "echo whats up > myfile2\n",
    "echo goodbye > myfile3\n",
    "echo hello again > anotherfile\n",
    "```\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "ls my*\n",
    "```\n",
    "which says list all files that begin with my and end with ```*```, where ```*``` is a place holder for any character and any amount of them. This should list our first three files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also find all files that have the root \"file\" anywhere in their names, as\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls *file*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use ```?``` in a similar way, but remember it stands for any one character. So an appropriate use in our context might be\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls myfile?\n",
    "```\n",
    "What would you expect if we did\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "For this section we will use nano as our example, but if you'd like to use vi or emacs, that is fine too. If you have the time and intrigue, I would recommend learning vi, because it is powerful, widely used amongst astronomers, and on most computers, however, it has a steeper learning curve.\n",

This would immediately and permanently erase all files in the working directory, which would be a disaster. By using the ```-i``` flag, we protect ourselves against this."
