    "[VPython](http://vpython.org/) (Visual Python) is a 3D visualization and animation software that uses Python language, meaning you can make low-level animation using the Python syntax we have learned over the course. It is by no means \"professional quality\" animation software, but with some creativity and imagination, you can make some pretty cool animations that can also be a good tool for teaching purposes and science communication!\n",
