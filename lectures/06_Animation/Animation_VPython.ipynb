    "Now that we have a VPython kernel, let's start using it to make some simple animations. You may find this useful for your final projects, if you are interested in making animations of your project!\n",
    "\n",
    "One that you will notice, is that you **often can't re-run VPython code without restarting the entire kernel** (and therefore lose all of the variables you defined). Keep that in mind when writing code: you don't want to stack a bunch of VPython code in the same script. Rather, you should try to chunk VPython codes into their own scripts when possible. The other thing is that, if you are running VPython code in a Jupyter Notebook, it is best to put all of the code in a single cell. This is not recommended when writing standard Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you run a cell with VPython in it, it sometimes doesn't stop running even when the animation is finished, and keeps checking to see if any of the objects have changed. This means if you open a few VPython notebook and run them, you will quickly eat up your processor, and your computer may warm up. Just be mindful of how many scripts you are running. If you want to stop the animation when you are done with it, you need to restart the kernel, which you can do with the drop-down menu bar up top, or by typing:  `<0> + <0>`."
