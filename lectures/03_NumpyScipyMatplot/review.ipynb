In this mini-review, I want to review some of the big concepts and go over some worked examples of the material. This **is not an exhaustive** review, and you wil want to become familiar with all of the material covered in lectures and homeworks up till now. This is a good time to get clarification on topics that will be the building blocks for the rest of the course and, if you continue to program in Python after the class, the basis of your workflow in Python. First, let's come back to the statement we saw in the first lecture.\n",

Then run it from the command line like\n",

In this case, your code-run command would look like\n",
