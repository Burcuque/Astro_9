    "In this lesson, we will begin to study more advanced topics that make Python a powerful high-level language. We will start with an overview of the function object in Python, how to write them and how they operate. We will then look at how to import Python packages, which have pre-defined functions that accomplish certain tasks. In doing so, we will look at the most useful and commonly used built-in packages that come with a standard Python distribution. This will naturally lead us to then discussing the class object in Python, and in general the design of objection-oriented programming. Lastly, we will conclude with an overview of reading-in and writing-out data (aka Input/Output or I/O).\n",

    "\n",
    "You can think of a function in Python as a chunk of code that we have purposely separated from the rest of our code and given a name. At any point in the linear flow of our script, we can **call** this function and **pass it arguments** that allow it to run as we desire. Typically, a function will perform some calculation and will **return** the result, or will do something like take an existing data structure and append values to it. Let's start by writing some basic functions. The syntax for constructing a function is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def <func_name>(argument1, argument2, keyword-argument1=something, keyword-argument2=something):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This is the doc-string! Similar to the # character, the ''' characters mean that the following lines\n",
    "    are not evaluated by the interpreter and are comments meant to inform the user on how to use\n",
    "    this function.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    operation1 = argument1 * argument2\n",
    "    if keyword-argument1 is not something:\n",
    "        operation1 += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return operation1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the **indentation** specifies which lines of code are tied to the function."

    "### Namespaces and Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous test leads us to consider the concept of a ***namespace*** and ***scope***, which are intimately tied to the concept of a function in Python. A namespace is like a dictionary for the Python interpreter: it tells us which variable is attached to a certain piece of data. There can be multiple namespaces spanning a single program. The concept of scope tells us how to navigate the different namespaces depending on where we are within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spanning the entire program is the \"global\" namespace. When we define a variable like\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "for example, we are assigning the variable in the global namespace. Anytime we enter a function, however, we temporarily construct a \"local\" namespace. Variables defined in this namespace get preference while performing operations in this namespace. This leads to the construction of a hierarchy of namespaces, with local being nested inside of global. If we entered yet another function within the first function, we would create a doubly-nested set of namespaces. When performing an operation with a variable, we need to evaluate the its scope, which tells us which namespaces we can look in to search for the variable. A fundamental principle of scope tells us that when we are currently in some namespace, we can **always reach back** in the hierarcy to access the namespaces upstream that enclose us, but can **never reach forward** in the hierarchy to reach namespaces that are nested further down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take our function `my_func` for example. The global namespace exists everywhere, meaning we can access it within functions. Schematically, the namespaces we can access depending on where we are in the script are\n",
    "```\n",

First, we can see that even though we had previous defined `x = 0` in the global namespace, the scope of the function told us to look first in the local namespace to see if `x` existed. In this case it did, and it used the locally defined `x` instead of the global `x`. Second, we can see that we did not define `z` locally, so it went up a hierachy level to search `global`, and found it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime we enter a local namespace and then exit that namespace, the variables inside `local` are destroyed. This is important enough to state twice; the variables we define in `local` are lost unless we transport them back to the global namespace before we exit. This is actually a very convenient functionality of Python called ***garbage collection***, which 1) keeps `global` from being cluttered up by series of nested namespaces and 2) helps us recycle memory for future use. How can we transport `local` variables to `global`? Well, this is what the `return` command does at the end of a function: it sends the pointer of the desired object(s) to the global namespace, where a variable in the global namespace awaits its assignment."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have reviewed functions and module importing, we will cover another fundamental level of Pythonic abstraction: classes. Classes are not unique to Python. In fact, the term object-oriented programming (OOP) implies that a language is built to handle class structures. Here, we will cover how Python uses classes to form high-level abstractions of containerized objects. To be precise, an object in Python is a container that holds **methods (functions)** and **attributes (variables)**, which can be accessed with a `<object>.<method>` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, the modules we have been working with are like objects, in that they hold both methods `math.sin` and attributes `math.pi`. In fact, almost everything in Python is an object, like strings (which have their own methods as we will see later), and all of the data structures we saw before. Another thing that separates classes from functions besides the ability of a class to hold methods and attributes, is that to use the class, we cannot just call it from the interpreter like we would a function; to use a class we first need to ***instantiate*** it. Let's first learn what this means through an example."

In it, we have defined the **class variables** `self.var1` and `self.var2`. Notice that we have modified `func1` to utilize the attribute `self.var1`. What's going on here? Remember our discussion about namespaces and scope? Intuition tells us that `self.var1` should be destroyed after instantiation when the `__init__()` method is finished. What's happening, is that when within a class, the `self` object refernces the class itself. Meaning that when defining `self.var1`, we are promoting the variable the a class-wide namespace, which can be accessed at anytime by calling the class itself, both inside and outside the class."

An instance (or instantiation of the class) is like the actual car itself once it is made. I can have any number of actual cars from the initial blueprint, just as I could have an arbitrary number of instantiations of the original class. Methods of the object `My_Class` are therefore called class methods, and methods of `MC` are called instance methods."

We would like to store it somewhere, share it, or publish it! Even still, often we want to take someone else's data and perform our own operations on it. To do these things with data, we need to talk about how to write and read data, aka file input / output (I/O). One of the many built-in functions we haven't talked about is the `open()` function, which allows us to access data within files. It returns a file descriptor, which allows us to step through the file line-by-line and read in or write out data. This works well for basic text files, like a `.py`, `.sh`, `.txt`, `.tab`, and `.csv`. Let's try to read in the previous `module1.py` file we created before."
