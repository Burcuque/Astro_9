    "In this notebook, we will cover the very basics of the Python programming language. For this course, we will be using Python 3. At their core, programming languages are methods for manipulating data. Here, we will discuss the ways in which the Python language can be used to manipulate data for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, let's think about why Python has become so widely used not only amongst scientists, but also amongst programmers in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.\"\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "> -- https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/\n",
    "\n",
    "Python being an \"interpreted language\" implies there is no formal step for compiling one's code, instead there is an interpreter which can identify possible errors and translates Python code to lower-level code (not machine code). The term \"object-oriented\" refers to the fact that Python is designed to support the construction of complex data structures with methods and attributes. The term \"high-level\" means that the language forms abstractions around machine logic to be more readable and similar to human language. The term \"dynamic\" means that variables can be defined \"on-the-fly\" or dynamically, and can easily change their type and form. \n",
    "\n",
    "These aspects make Python a very readable, powerful and easy-to-use language. Compared to languages that are traditionally used for scientific programming, like C, C++ and Fortran, Python is easier to read, debug, interact with, can visualize data easier, and can be used to do just about anything with a shallower learning curve. Other high-level languages with similar features, like IDL and Matlab, are proprietary (and therefore expensive) and don't have the versatility of being able to do just about anything. Because Python is open-sourced, there has been an incredibly large number of modules and libraries that have been built by the Python community that enable Python to be used for almost any task. Python does have its limitations, however, and the most evident one is its speed. Because Python is interpreted and is a higher-level langauge, it tends to have larger computational overheads, and in some cases is over 100x slower than languages like Fortran. There are ways to optimize Python to mitigate this to some degree, which we may explore later in the course. However, for many contexts, *code development* tends to be a larger time overhead than *code runtime*, making Python the more time-efficient choice in the long-run. In addition, being able to program effectively in Python will not only help you write code faster and more efficiently, it is also a very attractive skill for jobs in the private sector and industry!\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully we have convinced you that learning Python is worth your time, particularly if you are interested in doing research in the physical sciences. Now, let's start learning Python with a hands-on approach."
