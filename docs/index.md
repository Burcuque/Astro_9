### Course Information
----
**Description**:
<br>
Astro 9: Python Programming in Astronomy is an introductory course on scientific programming in Python. It is aimed to benefit undergraduate students interested in learning programming skills useful for research in physical sciences, with an emphasis on physics and astrophysics. The course assumes no previous background in either the Python language, or in computer programming in general. We will begin by covering the basics of computer programming and Pythonic abstractions, and will then explore numerical modeling in astrophysical contexts, and analysis of astronomical data sets.
