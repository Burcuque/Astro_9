### Accessing a bash shell

You want to be able to manipuate files and data on your computer without having to use your mouse and cursor, but with your keyboard.
This enable you to manipulate many files at once, and also allows you to automate such processes.
We do this through shell programming.
A common shell language is bash, which we will use in this course.
If your computer runs a Linux or Unix operating system, you should be all set to easily access a bash shell.
If, however, you run Windows, there will be a little bit of work to do in order to access a bash shell.

If you run Windows 10 or higher, this has been made easier for you.
Follow <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/">this guide</a> to get started.

If you run an older version of Windows, you will have to resort to using applications like Cygwin to run Linux software on Windows.
See <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/41382/how-to-use-linux-commands-in-windows-with-cygwin/">here</a> for how to get started.
